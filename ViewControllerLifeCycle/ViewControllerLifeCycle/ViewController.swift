         This is also a good place to start something expensive.
         why kick off expensive things here instead of in viewDidLoad?
         Because we know we're on screen so it won't be a waste.
         By "expensive" we usually mean "time consuming" but could also mean battery or storage. (Resource)
         
         We mouse never block our UI from user interaction (thus background fetching, etc.)
         Our UI might need to come up incomplete and latter fill in when expenive operation is done.
         We us "spinning wheels" and such to let the user know we're fetching something expensive.
         1. start an animation
         2. long running code (expensive)
